## ⚙️ OSUI Engine
OSUI v0.0.9 Comes with a engine that works under the hood and can be manipulated to match your needs. Here are a few examples:
- Game engine
- Fluid simulation
- Velocity
This may seem like a gimmick but it's essential to provide features only when needed and prioritize performance to extend reliability. [Read more](/docs/0.0.8/engine)

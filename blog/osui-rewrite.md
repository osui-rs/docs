Why would i bother re-writing a TUI library? Well there was a LOT of things wrong with the old version of OSUI. It had bugs and lacks performance. v0.0.9 fixes all of those and hopefully we can achieve a better future for OSUI. With that being said. Let's get into what i plan on doing.

## ⚙️ OSUI Engine
OSUI v0.0.9 Comes with a engine that works under the hood and can be manipulated to match your needs. Here are a few examples:
- Game engine
- Fluid simulation
- Velocity
This may seem like a gimmick but it's essential to provide features only when needed and prioritize performance to extend reliability. [Read more](/docs/next/engine)

## ⚡️ Improvements
- 📌 Reliable
- 🌿 Minimal
- 🚀 Fast
- 📚 Better documentation (soon)
- 🧑🏻‍💻 Better codebase
